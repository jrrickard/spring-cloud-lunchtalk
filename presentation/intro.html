# Motivation & Pitfalls

## What's This Going to Cost?

# Then There Was Agile

--

## All About Speed

# Always Be Deploying

# Agile Doesn't Deploy Code

--

How long to deploy single line of code?

--

Time wasted on defining and deploying infrastructure

---

class: center

# Microservices!

--

## tiny

--

## ephemeral

--

## numerous

???

Answer single concern.
Small, manageable, distributed teams.
Testability.

## Thousands of service deployments

---

class: center, middle

# Common Problems

---

class: center, middle

# Shared Solutions

---

# I. Single Codebase

--

## Many Deploys

--

## No Sharing

--

(unless it's a library or another service)

---

# II. Dependencies

--

## Declare and Isololate Dependencies

--

jars, gemfile, leiningen, even...autoconf

---

# III. Config

--

## STRICT separation between code and configuration

--

### Environment Variables

--

Really!

???

OS agnostic.

Could you open source today without compromising credentials?

---

# IV. Backing Services

--

## Resources, All The Way Down

--

data stores, messaging, caching, metrics gathering, 3rd party APIs

--

Can be attached/detached at will

---

# V. Build, Release, Run

--

## Separate Build and Run

--

- Releases are immutable

--

- Changes generate a new release

--

- Run stage simple enough to automate (server crash)

---

# VI. Processes

--

## Stateless, Share Nothing Apps

---

# VII. Port Binding

--

## Exposed as a resource

--

### ...on a port

---

# VIII. Concurrency

--

---

# IX. Disposability

--

---

# X. Dev/Prod Parity

--

---

# XI. Logs

--

---

# XII. Admin Processes
